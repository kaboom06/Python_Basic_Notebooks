# Python_Basic_Notebooks
I am doing a workshop in my school in which I will be teaching students from 3 classes, 7th, 8th and 9th python. I have created these notebooks so that they can learn and practice from it.

The notebooks are made in jupyter notebook on vscode, but I will be teaching them on Google Collab and will then help them setup their python enviorments on their laptops.
Each notebook has an approximate time of how much time it should take you and has a small section explaining what it is doing and a part which has the contents of the notebook.
